            <p><b>AvoKydo Consulting</b>, rooted in Tampa, FL, operates as a fully remote-based entity. Founded and run solely by an industry expert with over seven years of recruiting experience, AvoKydo Consulting prepares to leverage the vast knowledge acquired across sectors like professional services, non-profits, fintech, and more. We own a domain and an SSL certification so you know we're legit. </p>
            <p class="resumeIntro"><b>Why We're Here</b></p>
            <p>Think of AvoKydo as that friend with all the good advice. Through sharing accumulated knowledge, we aspire to act as a guiding beacon, enabling individuals and businesses to realize and harness their inherent potential. For us, it's all about integrity, authenticity, transparency and sharing the love. </p>
            <p class="resumeIntro"><b>What We See</b></p>
            <p>Real talk, the current job market is wild. Between the post-COVID rollercoaster, tech wars, and now the advance of AI, AvoKydo Consulting seeks to address the emotional, mental, and financial strains faced by many. Whether you're on the job hunt, running a small business, or just trying to keep up with changing times, we're here to help you navigate the chaos. </p>
            <p class="resumeIntro"><b>Products & Services</b></p>
            <p>Offering a range of services, from resume crafting to personal web page portfolios, we strive to enhance personal and business brand visibility. Our unique offerings will eventually include QR Code implementation, comprehensive static web pages, and tailored website creation. A simple and clean cost breakdown and a personalized approach sets us apart. And heads up - we've got our sights on SEO and the marketing game too. </p>
            <p class="resumeIntro"><b>Our All-Inclusive Approach</b></p>
            <p>Age, background or avocado toast budgets? They don't define our clientele. We're here to serve everyone, because we could all use a bit of “hand-holding” and everyone deserves top-tier solutions. </p>
            <p class="resumeIntro"><b>Why AvoKydo</b></p>
            <p>Simple: we're not just here to deliver, we aim to educate. Besides transparent pricing, you'll be able to follow along, with the added advantage of learning how to replicate our services, through direct email correspondence. </p>
            <p class="resumeIntro"><b>Financial Outlook</b></p>
            <p>We're running on purpose, passion and no external funds. We are virtual, only splurging on the real essentials like domains, rebranding, and some digital goodies. </p>
            <p class="resumeIntro"><b>Where We're Heading</b></p>
            <p>We're not just dreaming big; we're building that dream brick by brick. We are focusing on building genuine connections with our regular clients, showcasing web portfolios, finding, and sharing ways for us to stay ahead. We're  not about being the best, but being consistently reliable. While we’re in the game to thrive and, of course, turn a profit, our commitment lies in transparent, fair pricing, steering clear of exploitation. And hey, no one's perfect. We'll be here, taking each day as it comes, learning, evolving, and sometimes just winging it, but always with integrity at our core. </p>
