---GitHub - Cheatsheet - Basics---

This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands:

    Commands related to a remote repository:
        
        git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
            Ex: git@github.com:omegamuffin91/avoConsulting.git

        git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

    Commands related to the workflow:
        
        git add . (Adds all changes in current directory to staging area)
        
        git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
            "-m" is a message flag

    Commands related to checking status or log history
        
        git status - checks the status off all git add|commit|push
        
        git log - shows all recent commits, with authors, date/times
    
    The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

        For example,

            git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
        
            git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
            
            git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
